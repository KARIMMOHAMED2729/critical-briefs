# Business Brief Categories Guide

This guide explains each category in the business brief with clarity and practical context.

## 1. Problem / Pain Point

**What it is:** The specific problem or frustration that customers experience today.

**Why it matters:** Without a real problem, there's no real business. Problems create willingness to pay.

**Key questions:**
- What frustrates people today?
- How painful is this problem? (annoying vs. critical)
- How often does this problem occur?
- What triggers this problem?

**Not a valid problem:**
- "People don't have X" (unless X solves a real pain)
- "Market is growing" (that's opportunity, not pain)
- "Nobody does Y" (maybe because Y isn't needed)

---

## 2. Target Customer

**What it is:** The specific person or organization who experiences the problem and will pay for the solution.

**Why it matters:** Can't sell to "everyone". Different customers have different needs, budgets, and buying processes.

**Key aspects:**
- **Who specifically:** Job title, role, industry, company size
- **Demographics:** Age, income, location (if relevant)
- **Psychographics:** Goals, fears, values, behaviors
- **Buying power:** Can they actually buy? Who approves budget?

**Red flags:**
- "Everyone who..." (too broad)
- "Companies that need..." (which companies specifically?)
- Customer has no budget or authority

---

## 3. Proposed Solution

**What it is:** How you solve the problem. The product or service you're building.

**Why it matters:** Must be feasible, different enough, and actually solve the problem better than alternatives.

**Key aspects:**
- **Core mechanism:** How does it work?
- **Key features:** What does it do?
- **Why this approach:** Why is this solution better than alternatives?

**Red flags:**
- Solution doesn't directly address the stated problem
- Requires massive behavior change
- Technically impossible or extremely difficult
- "It's like Uber but for X" without explaining why Uber model works here

---

## 4. Unique Value Proposition (UVP)

**What it is:** Why customers should choose you instead of competitors or alternatives.

**Why it matters:** If you're not better in a meaningful way, price becomes the only differentiator.

**Key aspects:**
- **Differentiation:** What makes you different?
- **Better, not just different:** Why does that difference matter to customers?
- **Defensibility:** Can competitors easily copy this?

**Common mistakes:**
- "Better quality" (everyone says this)
- "Better customer service" (hard to prove, easy to copy)
- "First mover" (rarely a sustainable advantage)
- Features that don't matter to customers

---

## 5. Business Model / Revenue Model

**What it is:** How you make money. The mechanism for converting value into revenue.

**Why it matters:** Great products fail without viable business models. Must be realistic about what customers will actually pay.

**Common models:**
- **Subscription:** Recurring monthly/annual payment
- **Transaction fee:** Percentage or fixed fee per transaction
- **Licensing:** One-time or annual license fee
- **Advertising:** Free to users, monetize attention
- **Marketplace:** Commission on transactions between parties
- **Freemium:** Free basic, paid premium

**Key questions:**
- Who pays? (user, buyer might be different)
- How much? (realistic willingness to pay)
- When? (upfront, monthly, per-use)
- Unit economics: Does it work at scale?

**Red flags:**
- "We'll figure out monetization later"
- Requires massive scale to work
- Depends on ads without proven engagement
- Price point doesn't match customer budget

---

## 6. Competition / Alternatives

**What it is:** What customers do today instead of using your solution.

**Why it matters:** "No competition" usually means "no market". Understanding alternatives shows you understand the market.

**Types of alternatives:**
- **Direct competitors:** Similar solution to same problem
- **Indirect competitors:** Different solution to same problem
- **Substitute behaviors:** How people cope without a solution
- **Status quo:** Doing nothing, living with the problem

**Key analysis:**
- What do they do well?
- What do they do poorly?
- Why will customers switch to you?
- What's their market position and funding?

**Red flags:**
- "We have no competition" (wrong or no market)
- "We're better in every way" (unrealistic)
- Ignoring massive incumbents with deep pockets

---

## 7. Go-to-Market Strategy

**What it is:** How you'll acquire customers and get your product into their hands.

**Why it matters:** Great products die because nobody knows they exist. Customer acquisition is often the hardest part.

**Common approaches:**
- **Direct sales:** Sales team reaches out to prospects
- **Inbound marketing:** Content, SEO, ads drive customers to you
- **Partnerships:** Other companies distribute/recommend you
- **Product-led growth:** Free tier or viral mechanics drive adoption
- **Community/word-of-mouth:** Users recruit other users

**Key questions:**
- Where do target customers spend time?
- What's the customer acquisition cost (CAC)?
- What's the sales cycle length?
- Do you need to educate the market?

**Red flags:**
- "It will go viral" (rarely happens organically)
- Depends on expensive sales team before product-market fit
- Requires customers to change ingrained habits
- No clear path from awareness to purchase

---

## 8. Key Metrics (KPIs)

**What it is:** Measurable numbers that indicate whether the business is working.

**Why it matters:** Can't improve what you don't measure. Metrics show truth beyond opinions.

**Essential metrics by stage:**

**Early stage (validation):**
- Customer interviews completed
- Wait list sign-ups
- Conversion rate from landing page
- Time to onboard/first value

**Growth stage:**
- Monthly Recurring Revenue (MRR) / Annual Recurring Revenue (ARR)
- Customer Acquisition Cost (CAC)
- Lifetime Value (LTV)
- Churn rate
- Active users (DAU/MAU)
- Net Revenue Retention

**Key principle:** LTV must be significantly greater than CAC (ideally 3x+)

**Red flags:**
- Vanity metrics (sign-ups without activation)
- No unit economics defined
- Metrics that don't tie to revenue

---

## 9. Market Size (TAM/SAM/SOM)

**What it is:** How big is the opportunity?

**Why it matters:** Investors need big markets. But beware: "billion dollar market" doesn't mean your business will be big.

**Three levels:**
- **TAM (Total Addressable Market):** Everyone who could theoretically use this
- **SAM (Serviceable Addressable Market):** Realistic segment you can reach
- **SOM (Serviceable Obtainable Market):** What you can realistically capture in 3-5 years

**Calculation approaches:**
- **Top-down:** Industry reports, market research
- **Bottom-up:** Number of customers × price × adoption rate
- **Value theory:** How much value you create × capture rate

**Red flags:**
- Only stating TAM without SAM/SOM
- Market size based on "everyone who uses smartphones"
- No realistic path to capture meaningful share
- Market too small to support a venture-backed business

---

## 10. Key Resources

**What it is:** Critical assets needed to build and run the business.

**Why it matters:** Helps identify gaps and investment needs early.

**Categories:**
- **People:** Founders, engineers, designers, sales, domain experts
- **Technology:** Infrastructure, licenses, IP, data
- **Capital:** How much cash needed to reach key milestones
- **Partnerships:** Distribution, suppliers, strategic relationships
- **Physical assets:** Equipment, inventory, real estate (if applicable)

**Key questions:**
- What resources do we have vs. need?
- What's the critical path resource?
- What's hardest to acquire?
- What resources are must-have vs. nice-to-have?

**Red flags:**
- Requires resources you can't realistically get
- Critical dependency on scarce talent (e.g., "need 10 senior ML engineers")
- Needs massive upfront capital before validation

---

## 11. Partners / Ecosystem

**What it is:** Other companies or organizations you'll work with to deliver value.

**Why it matters:** Partnerships can accelerate growth but also create dependencies and complexity.

**Types of partners:**
- **Distribution partners:** Help you reach customers
- **Technology partners:** Provide critical infrastructure or integrations
- **Supply partners:** Provide inputs for your product/service
- **Strategic partners:** Alignment on vision, mutual benefits

**Key questions:**
- Why would they partner with you?
- What's in it for them?
- How dependent are you on them?
- What if they become a competitor?

**Red flags:**
- Business model requires partnership with major player unlikely to care about small startup
- Single point of failure (one critical partner)
- "We'll partner with Google/Apple/Microsoft" without specific pathway

---

## 12. Risks and Assumptions

**What it is:** What must be true for this to work, and what could go wrong.

**Why it matters:** Helps prioritize what to test first and prepares for challenges.

**Types of risks:**
- **Market risk:** Will customers actually want this?
- **Technical risk:** Can we build it?
- **Execution risk:** Can we execute the plan?
- **Competitive risk:** What if competitors respond?
- **Regulatory risk:** Legal/compliance issues?
- **Timing risk:** Are we too early or too late?

**Critical assumptions to test:**
- Customers will pay $X for this solution
- We can acquire customers at $Y cost
- Technical approach is feasible
- Market is ready for this solution
- Key partnerships are achievable

**Key questions:**
- What's the riskiest assumption?
- How can we test it cheaply and quickly?
- What kills the business if we're wrong?

**Red flags:**
- Assuming everything will go according to plan
- No plan to de-risk key assumptions
- Fatal dependency on things outside your control

---

## 13. Timeline / Milestones

**What it is:** Key achievements and when you expect to reach them.

**Why it matters:** Shows you think realistically about execution. Helps track progress and identify when you're off track.

**Common milestones:**
- **Product:** MVP, beta, v1, major features
- **Customer:** First customer, 10 customers, 100 customers, first enterprise customer
- **Revenue:** First dollar, $10K MRR, $100K MRR, $1M ARR
- **Funding:** Bootstrapped runway, seed raise, Series A
- **Team:** First hire, key leadership roles filled

**Key principle:** Milestones should be specific, measurable, and tied to value creation (not just "launch the product")

**Red flags:**
- Timelines that assume everything goes perfectly
- No intermediate milestones (just "launch in 6 months")
- Milestones focused on outputs not outcomes ("build feature X" vs "achieve X adoption")

---

## 14. Budget / Funding Needs

**What it is:** How much money is needed and where it will be spent.

**Why it matters:** Running out of money is the #1 reason startups fail. Must be realistic about costs and runway.

**Key components:**
- **Runway:** How many months of operations can you fund?
- **Burn rate:** How much cash spent per month?
- **Major expenses:** People, infrastructure, marketing, legal, operations
- **Funding source:** Bootstrapped, friends/family, angels, VCs

**Budget categories:**
- Personnel (usually largest expense)
- Technology/infrastructure
- Marketing/customer acquisition
- Legal/compliance
- Operations/overhead

**Key questions:**
- How much to reach next major milestone?
- What's the minimum viable budget?
- When do you need to raise next round?
- Can you achieve profitability before running out of money?

**Red flags:**
- Underestimating costs (especially customer acquisition)
- No clear plan for what funding enables
- Runway less than 12 months after raise
- Burn rate that requires massive revenue growth to justify
