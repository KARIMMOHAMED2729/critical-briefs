# Critical Questions Library

This library contains challenging questions designed to stress-test business ideas and surface weak assumptions. Use these to push users toward realistic thinking.

## General Approach

**Tone:** Direct, skeptical, but not dismissive. Like a mentor who's seen businesses fail and wants to prevent it.

**Pattern:**
1. Listen to the claim
2. Ask "How do you know?"
3. Push for specifics
4. Point out contradictions
5. Challenge assumptions

**Avoid:**
- "That's a great idea!" (premature validation)
- Filling in gaps with your assumptions
- Accepting vague answers
- Moving on when something doesn't make sense

---

## Problem / Pain Point

### Surface-level answers
- "How do you know this is actually a problem?"
- "How painful is this? Does it cause people to lose money, time, or something else measurable?"
- "How often do people experience this problem? Daily? Weekly? Once a year?"
- "What do people do today when they encounter this problem?"
- "If this problem disappeared tomorrow, what would actually change for them?"

### Validating severity
- "Would people pay to solve this, or is it just mildly annoying?"
- "Is this a 'vitamin' (nice to have) or 'painkiller' (must have)?"
- "What's the cost of NOT solving this problem? Can people live with it?"
- "Who feels this pain most acutely? Who doesn't care?"

### Testing reality
- "Have you talked to people who have this problem? What did they say?"
- "How many people have you interviewed about this?"
- "Is this a problem YOU have, or a problem you think OTHER people have?"
- "What evidence do you have that this problem exists beyond your intuition?"

---

## Target Customer

### Avoiding "everyone"
- "You said 'small businesses' – which specific businesses? What size? Which industries?"
- "You said 'professionals' – which professions? What level? What age range?"
- "If you had to pick ONE specific person who represents your ideal customer, who would it be? Name them if possible."
- "Can you describe a real person you know who fits this customer profile?"

### Testing access
- "How will you reach these customers? Where do they spend time?"
- "Do these customers have budget for this? Who controls that budget?"
- "What's their buying process? Can they decide themselves or need approval?"
- "Why would they trust you enough to buy from you?"

### Testing willingness
- "Have any of these people told you they'd pay for this?"
- "What are they paying for today that's similar?"
- "What would make them switch from their current solution to yours?"
- "If they're not solving this problem today, why not? Too expensive? Not important enough?"

---

## Proposed Solution

### Technical reality
- "Can this actually be built? What's the hardest technical challenge?"
- "What technology exists today that makes this possible?"
- "What's the minimum version that actually solves the problem?"
- "How long would it take to build a working prototype?"

### Behavior change
- "Does this require people to change their behavior? How hard is that change?"
- "What needs to be different about the world for people to use this?"
- "Are you asking people to do something new, or do something they already do but differently?"
- "How many steps does someone need to take to get value from this?"

### Testing completeness
- "Does this actually solve the problem you described, or just part of it?"
- "What's missing from this solution that customers will still need elsewhere?"
- "Why this approach instead of other possible solutions?"

---

## Unique Value Proposition

### Avoiding generic claims
- "You said 'better quality' – better than what, specifically? How will customers know it's better?"
- "You said 'better service' – what does that mean in practice? Can competitors copy it?"
- "You said 'cheaper' – how much cheaper? Why can you be cheaper? Is that sustainable?"

### Testing differentiation
- "What can you do that competitors CAN'T do?"
- "If a competitor wanted to copy your key differentiator, how long would it take them?"
- "Why hasn't someone already done this if it's better?"
- "What stops bigger companies with more resources from crushing you?"

### Testing value
- "Does this difference actually matter to customers?"
- "Would customers pay more for this differentiator?"
- "Is this difference obvious to customers immediately, or do you need to educate them?"

---

## Business Model / Revenue

### Testing willingness to pay
- "How much do you think customers will pay? Why that number?"
- "What are they paying today for alternatives? Is your price higher or lower?"
- "Have you asked anyone if they'd pay this amount?"
- "At this price point, how many customers do you need to break even?"

### Testing unit economics
- "What does it cost you to acquire one customer?"
- "What does it cost you to serve one customer?"
- "How long before a customer generates enough revenue to cover acquisition cost?"
- "What happens if customer acquisition costs are 2x or 3x what you expect?"

### Monetization reality
- "Who actually pays – the user or someone else?"
- "When do they pay – upfront, monthly, per use?"
- "What if customers want to use it but not pay for it?"
- "How do you prevent people from getting the value without paying?"

### Scale requirements
- "How many customers do you need to make $1M in revenue?"
- "Is that realistic in the first year? Second year?"
- "What if it takes 2x or 3x longer to hit those numbers?"

---

## Competition / Alternatives

### "No competition" response
- "If nobody is solving this problem, why not? Maybe it's not a big problem?"
- "What do people do TODAY instead of using a solution like yours?"
- "Even if there's no direct competitor, what would people do if you didn't exist?"

### Understanding competitive position
- "What do the big competitors do better than you?"
- "Why haven't they already solved this problem?"
- "If they decide to enter your space, what stops them from winning?"
- "Do you need to compete on price? If so, how will you survive?"

### Switching costs
- "Why would someone switch from their current solution to you?"
- "What's the pain of switching? Is it worth it for the customer?"
- "How locked in are customers to existing solutions?"

---

## Go-to-Market Strategy

### Testing distribution
- "Where exactly will you find these customers?"
- "How will they hear about you?"
- "What marketing channels will you use? Have you tested them?"
- "Do you need to educate the market, or do they already know they want this?"

### Testing acquisition
- "How much will it cost to acquire one customer?"
- "Have you run any tests on customer acquisition channels?"
- "What if customer acquisition costs are 5x what you expect?"
- "How long is the sales cycle? Can you afford to wait that long?"

### Testing scale
- "Can this acquisition strategy scale, or does it only work for first 100 customers?"
- "Do you need a sales team? Can you afford one before product-market fit?"
- "What's your plan if 'organic growth' doesn't happen?"

### Viral / word-of-mouth
- "Why would someone tell their friends about this?"
- "What companies have successfully used viral growth in your space?"
- "What if it doesn't go viral? What's plan B?"

## Cross-Cutting Stress Tests

These questions cut across multiple categories and are useful throughout the conversation:

### Evidence and validation
- "How do you know this?"
- "Have you tested this assumption?"
- "How many people have you talked to about this?"
- "What evidence do you have beyond intuition?"
- "What if you're wrong about this?"

### Specificity
- "Can you be more specific?"
- "Can you give me an example?"
- "What exactly do you mean by that?"
- "Describe a specific person/company/situation where this applies"

### Alternatives and failure
- "What else have you considered?"
- "Why this approach instead of X?"
- "What's plan B?"
- "What would make you give up on this idea?"

### Scale and sustainability
- "Does this work at 10 customers? 100? 10,000?"
- "What breaks as you scale?"
- "Can you afford to keep doing this?"
- "What happens when competitors copy you?"

## Conversation Flow Tips

**Start gentle, build pressure:**
Begin with open questions, then get more pointed as you identify weak spots.

**Good:** "Tell me about the problem" → "How do you know this is a problem?" → "How many people have confirmed this?" → "What did they say when you asked if they'd pay?"

**Follow the thread:**
When you sense uncertainty, dig deeper on that specific point before moving on.

**Good:** If user says "small businesses" ask "which specific types?" then "what size?" then "have you talked to any?"

**Name the elephant:**
If something doesn't add up, say it directly.

**Good:** "You said the market is huge but nobody is solving this. That usually means it's not actually a valuable problem. Why do you think this is different?"

**Demand evidence:**
Whenever possible, push for concrete evidence over assumptions.

**Good:** "Have you talked to potential customers?" not "Do you think customers would want this?"

**Use math to expose problems:**
Numbers don't lie. Calculate unit economics, required scale, etc.

**Good:** "At $50/month and $500 CAC, you need customers to stay for 10 months just to break even. What's your expected churn rate?"
