# Red Flags in Business Ideas

This guide catalogs common warning signs that indicate a business idea needs more work, pivoting, or abandonment. Use these to quickly identify fundamental problems.

## Critical Red Flags (Likely Fatal)

These are serious problems that often can't be overcome:

### "No competition because nobody has thought of it"

**Why it's fatal:** If it's a good idea in a real market, someone has tried it. "No competition" usually means:
- No real market demand
- Technical barriers you haven't discovered yet
- Economics don't work
- Regulatory issues

**What to probe:**
- "Have you searched extensively? Are you sure?"
- "Why hasn't anyone solved this if it's valuable?"
- "What do people do TODAY instead?"

---

### "We'll figure out monetization later"

**Why it's fatal:** If you can't articulate how money changes hands, you don't understand your business.

**What to probe:**
- "Why would someone pay for this?"
- "What are they paying for today that's similar?"
- "At what point does this stop working without revenue?"

**Only acceptable if:**
- Clear path to monetization exists after user base (like social networks)
- Team has track record of successful "growth first" models
- User engagement metrics that prove value

---

### "It will go viral"

**Why it's risky:** Virality is extremely rare and unpredictable. Can't be the only growth strategy.

**What to probe:**
- "Why would someone share this with friends?"
- "What existing products have gone viral in this category?"
- "What's your backup plan if it doesn't go viral?"

**Red flags within red flags:**
- No inherent sharing mechanism
- Value doesn't increase with network size
- No successful viral products in this category

---

### Solution looking for a problem

**Symptoms:**
- "We can use AI/blockchain/VR for..."
- Technology-first, not problem-first
- Can't articulate clear customer pain

**Why it's fatal:** Cool technology ≠ viable business. Customers buy solutions to problems, not technology.

**What to probe:**
- "What problem does this solve?"
- "Do customers know they have this problem?"
- "Why does this need [specific technology]?"

---

### Requires massive behavior change

**Examples:**
- "People will start doing X instead of Y"
- "This will replace [entrenched behavior]"
- "Once people understand, they'll switch"

**Why it's risky:** Behavior change is slow and expensive. Even good products fail if they require too much change.

**What to probe:**
- "How ingrained is the current behavior?"
- "How much better does this need to be to justify switching?"
- "Who has successfully changed this behavior before?"

---

### Fatal dependency on major player

**Examples:**
- "We need Google/Apple/Amazon to partner with us"
- "Once we integrate with Salesforce/SAP/Oracle..."
- "This only works if Meta/Microsoft/etc. gives us access"

**Why it's fatal:** Big companies don't care about small startups. They'll ignore you, copy you, or crush you.

**What to probe:**
- "Why would they work with you?"
- "Can the business work without them?"
- "What if they build this themselves?"

---

## Serious Red Flags (Difficult but Possibly Surmountable)

### Underestimating competition

**Symptoms:**
- "Our competitors are outdated/bad/stupid"
- "We'll just do it better"
- Not acknowledging incumbents' advantages

**Why it's risky:** Incumbents have resources, relationships, and market knowledge. They're not stupid, just optimized for different things.

**What to probe:**
- "What do they do well? Why are customers still with them?"
- "What prevents them from doing what you're doing?"
- "What advantages do they have over you?"

---

### Targeting "everyone"

**Symptoms:**
- "Anyone who..."
- "All businesses need..."
- "Everyone with a smartphone..."

**Why it's risky:** Can't build, market, or sell to "everyone." Different segments need different things.

**What to probe:**
- "Who needs this MOST?"
- "Who will be the first 10 customers?"
- "Describe ONE specific person who represents your customer"

---

### Assuming "build it and they will come"

**Symptoms:**
- No clear distribution strategy
- "We'll use social media/SEO/content marketing"
- "It's so good people will naturally find it"

**Why it's risky:** Distribution is usually harder than building the product. Most startups fail from lack of customers, not lack of product.

**What to probe:**
- "Where will you find first 100 customers?"
- "How much will it cost to acquire a customer?"
- "Have you tested any acquisition channels?"

---

### Unrealistic timelines

**Symptoms:**
- "We'll launch in 3 months"
- "We'll have 10,000 users by end of year"
- No buffer for problems

**Why it's risky:** Everything takes longer than expected. Unrealistic timelines lead to rushed/bad product and burnout.

**What to probe:**
- "What needs to happen in those 3 months?"
- "Have you built something like this before?"
- "What if it takes 2x or 3x longer?"

---

### Insufficient runway

**Symptoms:**
- Less than 12 months of funding
- No plan for next funding round
- Assuming quick revenue

**Why it's risky:** Fundraising takes 3-6 months. Product and traction take longer than expected. Running out of money kills businesses.

**What to probe:**
- "How long until you run out of money?"
- "When do you need to raise next round?"
- "What if revenue takes 6 months longer than expected?"

---

### Weak unit economics

**Symptoms:**
- CAC > LTV
- Long payback period
- Low margins

**Why it's risky:** Can't scale a business that loses money on each customer.

**What to probe:**
- "What does it cost to acquire a customer?"
- "How much revenue does a customer generate?"
- "How long until you break even on a customer?"

**Minimum viable:** LTV should be at least 3x CAC

---

## Market Red Flags

### Market too small

**Symptoms:**
- "It's a $50M market"
- Niche within a niche
- Only viable in one geography

**Why it's risky:** Can't build a venture-scale business in a small market. Also limits exit opportunities.

**What to probe:**
- "How many potential customers exist?"
- "What's realistic market capture in 5 years?"
- "Is this big enough to build a meaningful business?"

**Note:** Small markets are fine for lifestyle businesses, not venture-backed startups.

---

### Market too early

**Symptoms:**
- "In 5 years, everyone will..."
- Requires technology that doesn't exist yet
- Requires social change

**Why it's risky:** Being too early = being wrong. Burn capital waiting for market to materialize.

**What to probe:**
- "What needs to change for this market to exist?"
- "Is that change happening now or someday?"
- "Who else has tried this? What happened?"

---

### Fragmented market

**Symptoms:**
- No dominant player
- Every customer needs customization
- Difficult to scale sales

**Why it's risky:** Hard to build repeatable sales process. Every deal is custom.

**What to probe:**
- "Why is the market fragmented?"
- "Can you serve multiple segments with one product?"
- "What's the path to repeatability?"

---

## Product Red Flags

### Too many features

**Symptoms:**
- "It will do X, Y, Z, and also W"
- Trying to be "all-in-one" from day one
- Feature list keeps growing

**Why it's risky:** Dilutes focus, slows development, confuses customers. Usually means don't know what's actually valuable.

**What to probe:**
- "If you could only build ONE feature, which one?"
- "What's the minimum version that provides value?"
- "Which features are must-have vs. nice-to-have?"

---

### Solving your problem, not their problem

**Symptoms:**
- "I wanted this so I built it"
- Haven't validated with other potential customers
- Assumes others have same problem

**Why it's risky:** Market of one. Your specific needs might not generalize.

**What to probe:**
- "How many other people have confirmed they have this problem?"
- "Have you talked to potential customers?"
- "What do they do today to solve this?"

---

### Complex product for unproven market

**Symptoms:**
- Requires months/years to build MVP
- Can't test core hypothesis without full build
- High technical risk

**Why it's risky:** Burning time and money before learning if anyone wants it.

**What to probe:**
- "Can you test the core hypothesis with a simpler version?"
- "What's the fastest way to learn if this is valuable?"
- "Could you fake this with manual processes first?"

---

## Team Red Flags

### Missing critical skills

**Symptoms:**
- Technical idea with no technical co-founder
- No one with sales/marketing experience
- No domain expertise

**Why it's risky:** Have to hire critical skills you can't evaluate. Slows everything down.

**What to probe:**
- "Who on the team can build this?"
- "Who can sell this?"
- "Who understands this market/customer?"

---

### Solo founder (in complex space)

**Why it's risky:** Complex businesses need multiple perspectives and skills. Solo founders burn out, have blind spots, and investors are more skeptical.

**When it's okay:**
- Simple product/market
- Founder has deep expertise
- Path to profitability without funding

**What to probe:**
- "Why go solo vs. finding co-founder?"
- "What skills are you missing?"
- "Who can you lean on for blind spots?"

---

### Part-time founders

**Why it's risky:** Can't compete with full-time teams. Signals lack of commitment.

**What to probe:**
- "When will you go full-time?"
- "What needs to happen to make that leap?"
- "Can you realistically compete part-time?"

---

## Financial Red Flags

### Burning cash with no traction

**Symptoms:**
- High burn rate
- No revenue
- No user growth
- No clear path to either

**Why it's fatal:** Running out of runway with nothing to show.

**What to probe:**
- "How many months of runway left?"
- "What metrics are improving?"
- "What would you do differently if you had 6 months left?"

---

### Complicated revenue model

**Symptoms:**
- "We have multiple revenue streams"
- "It depends on..."
- Takes 5 minutes to explain how you make money

**Why it's risky:** Complicated = unproven. Usually means haven't figured out what works.

**What to probe:**
- "What's the PRIMARY way you make money?"
- "Which revenue stream will be biggest?"
- "Why not focus on just one?"

---

### Requires massive scale to work

**Symptoms:**
- "At 1M users, this will work"
- Low margins requiring volume
- Network effects only kick in late

**Why it's risky:** Might run out of money before reaching scale. Can't survive as small business.

**What to probe:**
- "Does this work at 1,000 users? 10,000?"
- "How will you survive until reaching scale?"
- "What if you never reach that scale?"

---

## How to Use These Red Flags

### 1. Listen for patterns
Don't interrupt immediately when you hear a red flag. Let the user explain fully, then probe the weak point.

### 2. Combine red flags
One red flag = caution. Multiple red flags = serious problems.

Example: "No competition" + "Will go viral" + "No specific customer" = likely doomed

### 3. Differentiate fatal vs. fixable
- **Fatal:** Core premise is flawed (no market, impossible economics)
- **Fixable:** Execution issues (wrong initial customer, need to pivot GTM)

### 4. Be direct but constructive
**Bad:** "This will never work"
**Good:** "This is going to be really hard because X. How do you plan to overcome that?"

### 5. Offer perspective
Share why this is a red flag by referencing similar failures or challenges.

**Good:** "Many startups have tried 'build it and they will come' distribution. Most fail because..."

### 6. Push for evidence
Red flags often reveal assumptions. Ask for evidence.

**Good:** "You said no competition. Have you searched [specific places]? What did you find?"

### 7. Suggest tests
When you identify red flags, suggest cheap ways to de-risk.

**Good:** "Before building this, could you manually do it for 10 customers to validate demand?"

## Example Red Flag Conversations

### Example 1: "No Competition"

**User:** "Nobody is doing this, which is why it's a great opportunity."

**You:** "That's interesting. If it's valuable and nobody's doing it, there's usually a reason. Let me ask—have you searched [specific places where competitors would be]?"

**User:** "I've done some googling..."

**You:** "What did you find? Sometimes competitors don't show up in Google searches. Have you checked Product Hunt, Crunchbase, industry conferences? What do people do TODAY instead of this?"

**User:** "They just deal with the problem..."

**You:** "If they're willing to live with the problem, how painful is it really? Would they pay to solve it?"

### Example 2: "It Will Go Viral"

**User:** "Once people see this, they'll share it with everyone."

**You:** "Why would someone share this? What's their incentive?"

**User:** "Because it's useful..."

**You:** "Useful products don't automatically go viral. What successful viral products exist in your space? What made them viral?"

**User:** "Well, Dropbox had that referral program..."

**You:** "Right—they DESIGNED viral mechanics with incentives. What's your viral mechanism? And what if it doesn't go viral—what's plan B for customer acquisition?"

### Example 3: Targeting "Everyone"

**User:** "Anyone with a smartphone could use this."

**You:** "That's billions of people. But they all have different needs. Who needs this MOST? Who has the biggest pain?"

**User:** "Young professionals in cities."

**You:** "Still pretty broad. Can you describe ONE specific person? Their job, age, what they do on weekends, what apps they use?"

**User:** "Um, like a 28-year-old marketing manager in New York..."

**You:** "Good—let's use that person as our reference. What's their specific pain? How do they try to solve it today?"
